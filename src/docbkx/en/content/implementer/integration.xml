	<title>Integration concepts</title>
	<para> DHIS2 is an open platform and its implementers are active contributors to
		interoperability initiatives, such as openHIE. The DHIS2 application database is designed
		with flexibility in mind. Data structures such as data elements, organisation units, forms
		and user roles can be defined completely freely through the application user interface. This
		makes it possible for the system to be adapted to a multitude of local contexts and
		use-cases. DHIS2 supports many requirements for routine data capture and analysis emerging
		in country implementations. It also makes it possible for DHIS2 to serve as a basic
		management system in domains such as <xref linkend="Integration_and_interoperability"/>.</para>

		<title>Integration and interoperability</title>
		<para>Based on its platform approach, DHIS2 is able to receive and host data from different data
			sources and share it to other systems and reporting mechanisms. An important distinction
			of integration concepts is the difference between data integration and systems
			interoperability: </para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para> When talking about <emphasis role="bold">integration</emphasis> , we think
					about the process of making different information systems appear as one, making
					data available to all relevant users as well as the harmonization of definitions
					and dimensions so that it is possible to combine the data in useful ways.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para> A related concept is <emphasis role="bold">interoperability</emphasis> ,
					which is one strategy to achieve integration. We consider DHIS2 interoperable
					with other software applications because of its capability to exchange data. For
					example, DHIS2 and OpenMRS are interoperable, because they allow to share data
					definitions and data with each other. Interoperability depends on standards for
					data formats, interfaces, codes and terminologies. These would ideally be
					internationally balloted standards, but in practice may also consist of de facto
					standards (which has wide acceptance and usage but is not necessarily formally
					balloted in a standards development organisation) and other more local
					agreements within a particular context. </para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para> To say that something is integrated, then, means that they share something, and that
			they are available from one place, while interoperability usually means that they are
			able to do this sharing electronically. DHIS2 is often used as an integrated data
			warehouse, since it contains (aggregate) data from various sources, such as <xref
				linkend="Objectives_of_integration"/> . These data sources share the same platform,
			DHIS2, and are available all from the same place. These subsystems are thus considered
			integrated into one system. </para>
		<para> Interoperability in addition will integrate data sources from other software
			applications. For example, if census data is stored in a specialized <xref
				linkend="Health_information"/> , interoperability between this database and DHIS2
			would mean that census data would also be be accessible in DHIS2. </para>
		<para> Finally, the most basic integration activity (that is not always taken into account
			in the interoperability discussion) is the possibility to integratedata from existing
			paper systems or parallel vertical systems into DHIS2. Data will be entered directly
			into DHIS2 without passing through a different software application. This process is
			based on creating consistent indicator definitions and can already greatly reduce
			fragmentation andenhance data analysis through an integrated data repository. </para>

		<title>Objectives of integration</title>
		<para> In most countries we find many different, <emphasis role="bold">isolated</emphasis>
			health information systems, causing many information management challenges. Public
			Health Information System have seen an explosive and often uncoordinated growth over the
			last years. Modern information technology makes it less costly to implement ICT4D
			solutions, which can lead to a high diversity of solutions. A staggering example was the
			mHealth moratorium declaration of Uganda´s MoH in 2012, as a reaction to an avalanche of
			around <link
				xlink:href="http://www.ictworks.org/2012/02/22/ugandan-mhealth-moratorium-good-thing"
				>50 mHealth solutions</link> that were implemented within the course of a few years.
			Most of these solutions were standalone approaches that did not share their data with
			the national systems and rarely were developed beyond pilot status. </para>
		<para> This may lead to the conclusion, that all systems should be connected or that
				<emphasis role="bold">interoperability is an objective</emphasis> in itself. However
			DHIS2 is often employed in contexts, where infrastructure is weak, and where resources
			to run even basic systems reliably are scarce. Fragmentation is a serious problem in
			this context, however interoperability approaches can only resolve some of the
			fragmentation problems - and often interoperability approaches result in an additional
			layer of complexity. </para>

		<para> Systems interoperability therefore seems as one possibility to remove fragmentation
			and redundancies and give public health officers a concise and balanced picture from
			available data sources. However the effort of connecting many redundant software
			solutions would be very high and therefore seems questionable. In a first step, focus
			should be on <emphasis role="bold"> reducing the number of parallel systems </emphasis>
			and identifying the most relevant systems, afterwards these relevant systems can be
			integrated. </para>
		<para> On this background, we want to define the major objectives of DHIS2 integration
			approaches: <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis role="bold">Calculation of indicators</emphasis> : Many indicators
						are based on numerators and denominators from different data sources.
						Examples include mortality rates, including some mortality data as numerator
						and population data as denominator, staff coverage and staff workload rates
						(human resource data, and population and headcount data), immunization
						rates, and the like. For the calculation, you need both the numerator and
						denominator data, and they should thus be integrated into a single data
						warehouse. The more data sources that are integrated, the more indicators
						can be generated from the central repository. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis role="bold">Reduce manual processing</emphasis> and entering of
						data: With different data at the same place, there is no need to manually
						extract and process indicators, or re-enter data into the data warehouse.
						Especially interoperability between systems of different data types (such as
						patient registers and aggregate data warehouse) allows software for
						subsystems to both calculate and share data electronically. This reduces the
						amount of manual steps involved in data processing, which increases data
						quality. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis role="bold">Reduce redundancies</emphasis> : Often overlapping and
						redundant data is being captured by the various parallel systems. For
						instance will HIV/AIDS related data elements be captured both by both
						multiple general counselling and testing programs and the specialized
						HIV/AIDS program. Harmonizing the data collection tools of such programs
						will reduce the total workload of the end users. This implies that such data
						sources can be integrated into DHIS2 and harmonized with the existing data
						elements, which involves both data entry and data analysis requirements.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Improve <emphasis role="bold">organizational aspects</emphasis> : If all
						data can be handled by one unit in the ministry of health, instead of
						various subsystems maintained by the several health programs, this one unit
						can be professionalized. With staff which sole responsibility is data
						management, processing, and analysis, more specialized skills can be
						developed and the information handling be rationalized. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Integration of <emphasis role="bold">vertical programs</emphasis> : The
						typical government health domain has a lot of existing players and systems.
						An integrated database containing data from various sources becomes more
						valuable and useful than fragmented and isolated ones. For instance when
						analysis of epidemiological data is combined with specialized <xref
							linkend="nn"/> data, it will give a more complete picture of the
						situation. </para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para> DHIS2 can help streamlining and <emphasis role="bold"> simplifying system
				architecture </emphasis> , following questions such as: What is the objective of the
			integration effort? Can DHIS2 help reduce the number of systems? Can an DHIS2
			integration help provide relevant management information at a lower cost, at at higher
			speed and with a better data quality than the existing systems? More practical

		<title>Health information exchange</title>
		<para>Since there are different use-cases for health information, there are different types
			of software applications functioning within the health sector. We use the term
			architecture for health information to describe a plan or overview of the various
			software applications, their specific uses and data connections. The architecture
			functions as a plan to coordinate the development and interoperability of various
			subsystems within the larger health information system. It is advisable to develop a
			plan that covers all components, including the areas that are currently not running any
			software, to be able to adequately see the requirements in terms of data sharing. These
			requirements should then be part of specifications for the software once it is developed
			or procured.</para>
		<para> The <emphasis role="bold">openhealth information exchange (openHIE)</emphasis> is an
			interoperable interpretation of this architecture, with an HMIS or DHIS2 often assuming
			a significant role in it.The openHIE framework has been developed with a clear focus on
			countries in low resource settings, through the participation of several institutions
			and development partners, including the Oslo HISP program. </para>
		<para> The schematic overview below shows the main elements of the openHIE framework,
			containing a component layer, an interoperability services layer and external systems. <screenshot>
				<mediaobject>

						<!--Please provide the reference to image in fileref attribute-->
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</screenshot>
		</para>
		<para>The openHIE component layer covers meta or reference data (Terminology, Clients,
			Facilities), Personal data (Staff, Patient History) and national health statistics. The
			purpose is to ensure the availability of the same meta data in all systems that
			participate in the corresponding data exchange (e.g. indicator definitions, facility
			naming, coding and classification). In some cases, like the case of the Master Facility
			Registry, the data may also be used to provide information to the general public through
			a web portal. While the interoperability layer ensures data brokerage between the
			different systems, the external systems layer contains several sub-systems, many at
			point of service level, with often overlapping functional range.</para>
		<para>There are different approaches to define an eHealth architecture. In the context of
			this DHIS2 guideline, we distinguish between approaches based on a 1:1 connection versus
			approaches based on an n:n connection (many-to-many).</para>
		<section xml:id="integrationSection" xreflabel="MIS/LMIS implementation in Senegal">
			<title>
				<emphasis>1-to1</emphasis> integration </title>
			<!--No subsection element in DTD, thats why using section element-->
			<para>In many countries a national HMIS is often the first system to be rolled out to a
				large number of facilities and to manage a large number of data on a monthly or
				quarterly basis. When countries start to develop their health system architecture
				further, DHIS2 often will be connected to some other systems. This connection is
				done directly through a simple script, which automates a data transfer.</para>
			<para>We talk of a 1:1 connection because it is limited to two systems. In the case of
				an LMIS/HMIS integration, one LMIS (e.g. openLMIS as is the case in Tanzania) will
				transfer data to DHIS2 as defined in the script. In case a second logistics system
				would want to transfer data to DHIS2 (e.g. commodity data for a specific disease
				program), a second script would have to written, to perform this task. These two
				scripts would then run independently from another, resulting in two separate 1:1
				connections.</para>
			<para>This hands-on approach often represents a first step and is one of the most common
				use cases on the way to an interoperable openHIE architecture.</para>

			<title>
				<emphasis>n-to-n</emphasis> integration </title>
			<!--No subsection element in DTD, thats why using section element-->
			<para> A different approach is based on placing a purpose-built software to serve as an
					<emphasis role="bold">interoperability layer</emphasis> or BUS approach,
				managing the data transfer between possibly several systems on either side (n:n).
				This could be the case if for example you wanted to collect stock level data through
				different LMIS applications, and then share it to a central warehouse LMIS, the HMIS
				and some vertical disease programs system. The openHIE reference software to assume
				this role is Jembi openHIM, but systems like Grameen Motech have also been used for
				this purpose as will be discussed below. </para>
			<para>While this approach may result in a higher initial effort, it promises to make
				further integration project easier, because the interoperability layer is being
				alimented with definitions and mappings that can be re-used for connecting the next
				systems.</para>
			<para> In practice, there are certain challenges to this approach. It takes a
				considerable effort of qualified resources to activate APIs and with each new
				release of any involved system, data flows require re-testing and if necessary
				adaptations. Also, to be successful these implementation projects typically have to
				go through a series of <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
					xlink:href="https://www.dhis2.org/downloads">
					<emphasis role="underline">complex steps</emphasis>
				</link> , such as the agreement on an interoperability approach embedded in the
				national eHealth strategy, the definition of data standards and sustainable
				maintenance structure, and attaining a stakeholder consensus on data ownership and
				sharing policies. There can be some long term consequences when data and systems are
				knitted together - it creates new roles, jobs and tasks which didn't exist before
				and may not have been planned for (metadata governance, complex system
				administration, boundary negotiators, etc.). </para>

			<para> At the <emphasis role="bold">language</emphasis> level, there is a need to be
				consistent about definitions. If you have two data sources for the same data, they
				need to be comparable. For example, if you collect malaria data from both standard
				clinics and from hospitals, this data need to describe the same thing if they need
				to be combined for totals and indicators. If a hospital is reporting malaria cases
				by sex but not age group, and other clinics are reporting by age group but not sex,
				this data cannot be analysed according to either of these dimensions (even though a
				total amount of cases can be calculated). There is thus a need to agree on uniform
				definitions. </para>
			<para> In addition to uniform definitions across the various sub-systems, <emphasis
					role="bold">data exchange standards</emphasis> must be adopted if data is to be
				shared electronically. The various software applications would need this to be able
				to understand each other. DHIS2 is supporting several data formats for import and
				export, including the most relevant standard ADX. Other software applications are
				also supporting this, and it allows the sharing of data definitions and aggregate
				data between them. For DHIS2, this means it supports import of aggregate data that
				are supplied by other applications, such as <link xlink:href="http://openmrs.org"
					>OpenMRS</link> (for patient management) and <link
					xlink:href="https://www.ihris.org/">iHRIS</link> (for human resources
				management). </para>
			<para> A crucial element of the architecture is how organize data <emphasis role="bold"
					>mapping</emphasis> . Typically the metadata of different systems does not match
				exactly. Unless an MoH has been enforcing a consequent data standard policy,
				different systems will have different codes and labels for a facility. one System
				may call it <emphasis role="italic">District Hospital - 123</emphasis> , the other
				system may refer to it as Malaria Treatment Centre - 15. To be able to transfer
				data, somewhere the information that these two facilities correspond needs to be
				stored. </para>
			<para>In the case of a 1:1 connection, this mapping has to be done for every connection,
				in case of an n:n interoperability approach, one side of the definitions can be
				re-used.</para>
			<para>In order to assure that the data can flow smoothly, you need to have clear
				responsibilities on both sides of the system regarding data maintenance and
				troubleshooting. For example, there need to be previously defined standard
				procedures for such activities as adding, renaming, temporarily deactivating or
				removing a facility on either of the two systems. Changes of database fields that
				are included in a transferred data record need also to be coordinated in a
				systematic way.</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Aggregate and transactional data</title>
		<para>DHIS2 has been expanding its reach into many health systems. Starting from its
			familiar grounds of aggregate data sets for routine data it has included patient related
			data and then data in the areas of HR, finance, logistics and laboratory management,
			moving towards operational or transactional data.</para>
		<para> We can differentiate between transactional and aggregate data. A <emphasis
				role="bold">transactional system</emphasis> (or operational system from a data
			warehouse perspective) is a system that collects, stores and modifies low level data.
			This system is typically used on a day-to-day basis for data entry and validation. The
			design is optimized for fast insert and update performance. DHIS2 can incorporate
			aggregate data from external data sources, typically aggregated in the space dimension
			(the organisation unit hierarchy), time dimension (over multiple periods) and for
			indicator formulas (mathematical expressions including data elements). </para>
		<para>When we look at a transactional system, such as a logistics software for the entire
			supply chain or parts of it, there is one fundamental decision to take: Do you need to
			track all detailed transactions at all levels, including such operations as returns,
			transfer between facilities, barcode reading, batch and expiry management? Or can you
			get most of your results using aggregate data?</para>
		<para> Supply chains can often be well controlled with aggregate data only, as long as data
			is provided reliably from all relevant levels and followed up upon. The main indicators
				<emphasis role="italic"> intake, consumption and stock level at the end of period
			</emphasis> can be managed without electronic transactions and often suffice to give the
			big picture, reducing the needs for system investment. </para>
		<para>
			<note>
				<para> The expectation, that more detailed data leads to better logistics management
					is not always fulfilled. Sometimes the ambitious attempt to regularly collect
					logistics transaction data results in less data quality, for example because the
					data recording, which may have to happen on a daily basis instead of a monthly
					or quarterly basis, is not carried out reliably. On the other hand, if the
					transactional system is well maintained and monitored, more detailed data may
					lead to discover inaccuracies and data quality challenges. Analysing these may
					help to discover root causes of some problems and improve the data quality in
					the long run. </para>
			</note>
		</para>
		<para> DHIS2 can assume different roles in interoperability scenarios. A common
			interoperability scenario is for DHIS2 to receive aggregate data from an operational
			system, in which case the operational system adds up the transactions before passing it
			on to DHIS2. However, DHIS2 may to a certain extent also be configured to store detailed
			transactional data, receiving it from external systems or through direct data entry in
			DHIS2. </para>
		<para>On this basis we try making a comparative overview, comparing aggregate DHIS2 data
			management with data management of external specialized system. This can serve as a
			rough orientation, but is not static since both the capabilities of DHIS2 and its
			interpretation by implementers are broadening with almost each release.</para>

			<title>Data sharing</title>
			<para> There are three sharing scenarios, (1) a simple <link
					xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
					xlink:href="https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en_full.html#export">
					<emphasis role="underline">data export</emphasis>
				</link> , (2) <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
					xlink:href="https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/developer/html/dhis2_developer_manual_full.html">
					<emphasis role="underline">DHIS2 apps and (3) external apps or websites
						connecting to the DHIS Web API</emphasis>
				</link> . Similar to the import functions described in the data input section, the
				most accessible way of data sharing is to use the data export functions that are
				available from the user menu, requiring little technical knowledge. </para>
			<para> Due to its modular design DHIS2 can be extended with <emphasis role="bold">
					additional software modules, which can be downloaded from the DHIS2 </emphasis>
				<link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
					xlink:href="https://www.dhis2.org/appstore">
					<emphasis role="underline">App store</emphasis>
				</link> . These software modules can live side by side with the core modules of
				DHIS2 and can be integrated into the DHIS2 portal and menu system. This is a
				powerful feature as it makes it possible to extend the system with extra
				functionality when needed, typically for country specific requirements as earlier
				pointed out. </para>
			<para>The downside of the software module extensibility is that it puts several
				constraints on the development process. The developers creating the extra
				functionality are limited to the DHIS2 technology in terms of programming language
				and software frameworks, in addition to the constraints put on the design of modules
				by the DHIS2 portal solution. Also, these modules must be included in the DHIS2
				software when the software is built and deployed on the web server, not dynamically
				during run-time.</para>
			<para> In order to overcome these limitations and achieve a looser coupling between the
				DHIS2 service layer and additional software artefacts, the DHIS2 development team
				decided to create a <emphasis role="bold">Web API</emphasis> . This Web API complies
				with the rules of the REST architectural style. This implies that: <itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para> The Web API provides a navigable and machine-readable interface to
							the complete DHIS2 data model. For instance, one can access the full
							list of data elements, then navigate using the provided hyperlink to a
							particular data element of interest, then navigate using the provided
							hyperlink to the list of forms which this data element is part of. E.g.
							clients will only do state transitions using the hyperlinks which are
							dynamically embedded in the responses. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> Data is accessed through a uniform interface (URLs) using a
							well-known protocol. There are no fancy transport formats or protocols
							involved - just the well-tested, well-understood HTTP protocol which is
							the main building block of the Web today. This implies that third-party
							developers can develop software using the DHIS2 data model and data
							without knowing the DHIS2 specific technology or complying with the
							DHIS2 design constraints. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>All data including meta-data, reports, maps and charts, known as
							resources in REST terminology, can be retrieved in most of the popular
							representation formats of the Web of today, such as HTML, XML, JSON, PDF
							and PNG. These formats are widely supported in applications and
							programming languages and gives third-party developers a wide range of
							implementation options.</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>This Web API can be accessed by different external information system. The effort
				needed for developing new information systems and maintaining them over time is
				often largely underestimated. Instead of starting from scratch, a new application
				can be built on top of the Web API.</para>
			<para> Extenal systems can offer different options for visualizing and presenting DHIS2
				data, e.g. in the form of dashboards, GIS and charting components. Web portals
				targeted at the health domain can use DHIS2 as the main source for aggregate data.
				The portal can connect to the Web API and communicate with relevant resources such
				as maps, charts, reports, tables and static documents. These data views can
				dynamically visualize aggregate data based on queries on the organisation unit,
				indicator or period dimension. The portal can add value to the information
				accessibility in several ways. It can be structured in a user-friendly way and make
				data accessible to inexperienced users. An example for this is the <link

		<title>DHIS2 maturity model</title>
		<para> Taking into account all the above elements on system architecture and data types,
			DHIS2 implementers have several options on how to approach implementations: <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Focus on transactional or aggregate data</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Focus on data integration or systems interoperability</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para> Given the efforts required to implement systems interoperability, many Ministries of
			Health are going for the pragmatic shortcut of integrating data such as basic stock
			level data <emphasis role="bold">directly into their existing national DHIS2</emphasis>
			. As a rapidly evolving platform, DHIS2 has been adding a lot of functionality over the
			last years, especially in DHIS2 Tracker. Taking the example of logistics data, the
			following main functions are currently available: <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para> Data entry form mirroring the widely used Report and Requisition
						(R&#038;R) paper form. Data entry by facilities is possible through the
						desktop browser or a mobile app, including in offline mode. These electronic
						forms can be filled by staff based on the paper stock cards, that are
						normally placed next to the commodity in the store room. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> DHIS2 can then produce reports for central decision making, giving
						commodity and program managers the possibility to accept or modify delivery
						suggestions. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Stock data can be transformed into logistics indicators, that can be put
						into context with other program indicators, for example cross-referencing
						number of patients treated with a specific pathology and corresponding drug
						consumption. </para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para> Although each country that we look at in the use cases has their own development path
			towards system integration, some common learnings can be drawn from their experiences.
			The maturity model below describes an evolutionary approach to cope with integration and
			interoperability challenges, allowing the different stakeholders in a national Health
			System to grow professional analytics and data usage habits. </para>
		<para> The maturity model suggests moving from aggregate data to transactional data and from
			stand-alone to interoperable systems (using the example of logistics data). <orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para> DHIS2 is often one of the first systems to cover the health
						administration and several facility levels of a country. At first core
						disease indicators are covered (for example corresponding to the 100 WHO
						Core Health Indicators). </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> In a second phase, different stakeholders seek to complement the disease
						and service delivery data they are reporting with basic LMIS data. This can
						be done on an aggregate basis in DHIS2, e.g. by including stock levels and
						consumption in periodic reports. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> At a more mature stage, there may be a legitimate need for specialized
						logistics systems, especially when a very detailed transactional view is
						wanted to have a more granular control, (e.g. returns, transfers between
						facilities, batch numbers and expiries, etc.). DHIS2 Tracker can offer some
						event or patient related data management functions, but cannot always
						respond to the needs for a specialized external system. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> In a mature technological and managerial environment, the logistics
						transactions can be shared to DHIS2 in an aggregate form, moving from a
						stand-alone to an integrated scenario. </para>

		<title>Implementation steps for successful data and system integration</title>
		<para> The purpose of this step-by-step DHIS2 Implementation Guide is to provide a

			and functional requirements. The guide is intended as a framework that can be adapted to
			the specific context of each country. The content describes specific examples for each
			step detailing user stories, data specifications, job aids and checklists to guide the
			use of the reference implementation software. The basic structure, including the 6

		<section>
			<title>Step 1: Define strategy, stakeholders and data usage objectives</title>
			<para> In a first step, the objectives of the integration project will be defined. As
				with every technology project, there should be a clear <emphasis role="bold">
					consensus on strategic and functional objectives </emphasis> . Technological
				innovation and feasibility should not be the sole driving force but rather a clearly
				defined organisational goal. Therefore this step is also intended to answer the
				question: “Why do we want to connect systems or integrate data from different
				sources with DHIS2?” </para>
			<para>On a practical level, this leads to questions on the data integration approach,
				such as:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Do you want to eliminate paper forms or even eliminate data sets that are
						redundant or not needed anymore?</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Can you integrate the (aggregate) data into DHIS2?</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Can you integrate the detailed (e.g. patient level or transactional) data
						into DHIS2, using DHIS2 tracker functions?</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> If you want to create a data exchange connection between DHIS2 and
						another system, how do you define ownership and responsibilities? </para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Activities to answer this question are described below and will lay the groundwork
				for an DHIS2 interoperability project.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Identify Stakeholders and Motivations</title>
				<para>It is in the nature of interoperability projects to have more than one
					stakeholder. Stakeholders from different areas need to agree on a common system
					approach, for example the team responsible for the national HMIS (e.g. the
					M#038;E department or Planning Department) and the Logistics Department in case
					of an LMIS implementation. These two main areas often have sub-divisions, e.g.
					in the LMIS area the procurement unit, the warehousing unit, the transport unit.
					In addition, stakeholders from disease specific programs will have their own
					regimens and commodity managers. In addition to these local actors,
					international partners (agencies, donors, iNGOs, consultancies) are often also
					involved in the decision making process.</para>
				<para> Therefore it´s interesting to look at the main motivations of the
					stakeholders and how to mitigate risks resulting from potential diverging
					interests. </para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para> Central MoH Departments such as M&amp;E Planning often are the main stakeholders for a
							standardisation of indicators and IT Systems </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<emphasis role="bold">Central IT departments</emphasis> have a general
							interest over (often locally controlled) technology choices and
							ownership, hardware and software purchases. They are often dealing with
							network and hardware issues but lack experience dealing with complex
							web-based architectures and data exchanges. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<emphasis role="bold">Specialized disease programs</emphasis> are often
							under pressure to deliver very program specific indicators, both for
							their own management but also responding to donor driven approaches.
							They may also feel more comfortable controlling their proper IT system
							to be sure their needs are prioritized. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							<emphasis role="bold">Specialized functional areas</emphasis> (such as
							Human Resources, Logistics, Hospital Management) are often in a sandwich
							position, having to cater to the information needs of several different
							stakeholders, while trying to achieve operational efficiency with
							limited resources. </para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para> By identifying who is interested to provide or utilize the data, the lead
					implementers can start to form a project team to inform the design and
					implementation. One method for characterizing stakeholders involves grouping
					interested parties by their functional roles. The existing infrastructure and
					procedures are also important to understanding governance and curation options.
					Understanding the stakeholders and their corresponding systems is a critical
					first step. Below are job aides to assist in this initial process. </para>

				<title>eHealth System inventory</title>
				<para> It is important to get a clear view on the overall IT systems landscape. This
					can help make sure that interoperability investment is done to strengthen the
					main systems and that the investments contribute to a <emphasis role="bold"
						>simplification</emphasis> of the system architecture. For example, if the
					system inventory shows that there are a lot of redundant functional systems,
					e.g. more than 10 different logistics systems or modules in a country, the
					interoperability project should try to contribute to a mid or long-term
					rationalization of this situation. This could mean to participate in a national
					consensus finding process to identify the most future-proof solutions, identify
					national “champions” for each speciality and develop a roadmap for aligning
					these systems or data and removing underutilized or redundant systems. </para>
				<para> Also in this context it is interesting to analyse whether simple indicators
					can be collected and managed in DHIS2 itself (as this is later explained in an

				<para>Clear national policies on data integration, data ownership, routines for data

				<title>Step 6: Ongoing Support</title>
				<para> While during the implementation phase a temporary support structure should be
					available, afterwards a permanent support structure needs to be set-up. The main
					challenge is to have clear responsibilities. In an ideal situation, we are
					dealing with two stable systems that each have already their own clearly defined
					support structure. </para>
				<para>However in reality some recurring challenges may have to be dealt with: Many
					Public Health System are undergoing dynamic developments, leading to changes in
					data collection needs or calculation of indicators.</para>
				<para> Interoperability tends to be a tedious technical and organisational charge.
					All of the three described initiatives have consumed a considerable effort of
					qualified <emphasis role="bold">resources</emphasis> to activate APIs. In
					addition, with each new release of any involved system, data flows require
					re-testing and if necessary adaptations. To be successful these implementation
					projects typically have to go through a series of complex steps, such as the
					agreement on an interoperability approach embedded in the national eHealth
					strategy, the definition of data standards and sustainable maintenance
					structure, and attaining a stakeholder consensus on data ownership and sharing
					policies. There can be some long term consequences when data and systems are
					knitted together - it creates <emphasis role="bold">new roles, tasks and
						categories of labour</emphasis> which need to be planned for (metadata
					governance, complex system administration, boundary negotiators, etc.). A
					solution could be to discuss the new responsibilities beforehand, assigning them
					to job descriptions, teams and specific positions. </para>
				<section>
					<title>Metadata responsibility</title>
					<para> Another important area is that of <emphasis role="bold">metadata
							governance</emphasis> , particularly in the scenarios of secondary use
						of data. In a stand-alone set-up, metadata, such as facility or commodity
						codes can be managed without much consideration of other stakeholder´s
						needs. But in an interoperability environment, metadata changes will have
						effects outside of the individual system. Metadata governance can be highly
						formalised through registries or more manual through human processes. </para>
					<para> In order to determine the appropriate approach, is it useful to estimate
						the expected <emphasis role="role">metadata maintenance effort</emphasis>
						and the consequences of unsynchronized metadata across different systems. In
						the case of the LMIS/DHIS2 integrations, there are potentially thousands of
						facility identifiers that could go out of synch. However normally, facility
						identifiers do not change often since the physical infrastructure of most
						public health system is relatively constant. As to the commodities, although
						regimes and priority drugs may change over time, the number of datasets is
						relatively small. </para>

			<title>Specific integration and interoperability use cases</title>
			<para> DHIS2 has been expanding its reach into many health systems. Starting from its
				familiar grounds of aggregate data sets for routine data it has included patient
				related data and then data in the areas of HR, finance, logistics and laboratory
				management. This is in line with the development of DHIS2 in many country settings,
				where implementers are pushing the use beyond its originally intended scope. </para>
			<para> This is also reflected in the overall system architecture. Since the expanding
				functionality of DHIS2 reduces the urgency to introduce or maintain other
				specialized systems, the number of potential data interfaces decreases. This
					<emphasis role="bold">reduced complexity</emphasis> in system architecture is
				certainly a benefit for a Health System with limited resources. </para>
			<para> For several years now, DHIS2 has grown its data management activities
				organically, allowing the actual usage to lead to sometimes unforeseen solutions.
				However, there are also limits to where leveraging DHIS2 seems useful. In the
				following sections, special systems will be described. </para>

						<emphasis role="bold">a) Introduction</emphasis>
					</para>
					<para> Logistics Management Systems <emphasis role="bold">(LMIS)</emphasis> or
						Supply Chain Management Systems <emphasis role="bold">(SCM)</emphasis> serve
						to replace paper systems to increase standardization, transparency,
						timeliness of procurement, efficiency, safety, cost-effectiveness, and to
						reduce waste. National SCMS/LMIS can cover such functions as commodity
						planning, budgeting, procurement, storage, distribution and replenishment of
						essential drugs and consumables. </para>
					<para>
						<emphasis role="bold">b) Implementing LMIS in DHIS2</emphasis>
					</para>
					<para> Supply chains can often be well controlled with aggregate data only, as
						long as data is provided reliably from all relevant levels and followed up
						upon. The main indicators intake, consumption and stock level at the end of
						period can be managed without electronic transactions and often suffice to
						give the big picture, reducing the needs for system investment. As a rapidly
						evolving platform, DHIS2 has been adding a lot of functionality over the
						last years, especially in DHIS2 Tracker. The following main functions are
						currently available: <itemizedlist>
							<listitem>
								<para> Data entry form mirroring the widely used Report and
									Requisition (R&#038;R) paper form. Data entry by facilities is
									possible through the desktop browser or a mobile app, including
									in offline mode. In online mode the form can calculate
									requisition proposals, offering the facility manager to modify
									the request and comment on it. These electronic forms can be
									filled by staff based on the paper stock cards, that are
									normally placed next to the commodity in the store room. </para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para> DHIS2 can then produce reports for central decision making,
									giving commodity and program managers the possibility to accept
									or modify delivery suggestions. </para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para> Stock data can be transformed into logistics indicators, that
									can be put into context with other program indicators, for
									example cross-referencing number of patients treated with a
									specific pathology and corresponding drug consumption. </para>
							</listitem>
						</itemizedlist>
					</para>
					<para>
						<emphasis role="bold">c) Interoperability Options</emphasis>
					</para>
					<para> LMIS is an area where a multitude of parallel, overlapping or competing
						software solutions can be found in a single country. As identified in a JSI
						study in 2012 (Ghana Ministry of Health, July 2013: Landscape Analysis of
						Supply Chain Management Tools in Use), eighteen (18!) different software
						tools were documented as being in use within the public health supply chain
						in Ghana alone. </para>
					<para> Although a basic LMIS configuration based on aggregate data can take you
						very far, in some cases a transactional LMIS is necessary if you need to
						track such detailed operations as returns, transfer between facilities,
						barcode reading, batch and expiry management. Also some specialized HQ
						functions such as creating forecasting, replenishment and elaborate control
						reports are often done in specialized tools. </para>
					<para> DHIS2 has integrated aggregate data from external systems such as
						openLMIS and CommCare through automated data interfaces. As a result, stock
						data is available in shared dashboards, displaying health service and stock
						data next to each other. </para>
